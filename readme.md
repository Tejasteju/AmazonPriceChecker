### **urls.txt** should be in the format :
*first line should contain the [user-agent](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent)    	

*second line should be the _email address_ to which you wish to recieve the prices

*from third line onwards you can add as many _urls_ you like but should be in line by line

*To get the _urls_ just search the product in **amazon** then copy and paste the _url_ to **urls.txt** file
